#Why I'm not an expert




Working in a technical profession I am compelled to keep abreast of new tools and techniques; however the sheer volume of new languages, frameworks, libraries and associated best practice can make this compulsion exhausting!

Beyond basic awareness many people have a desire to become experts in these tools before they feel comfortable using them. This aspiration can become paralysing, resulting in a fear or reluctance to move away from the comfort of previous experience.

This fear is normal, but unfounded; many years ago I took the conscious decision to opt for a breadth first learning approach. I had not heard the term at the time and it was more a desire to understand all the options before diving in but I have continued to focus on learning new things versus becoming expert in one.

When choosing a technical platform for this blog I went through many different options before choosing [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### .NET MVC

### Ember

### Vue

### Redis &amp; Markdown
