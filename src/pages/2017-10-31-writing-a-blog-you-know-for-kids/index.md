Firstly, welcome to not quite my [first attempt](/ten-simple-things-destiny-needed) at writing a blog post. This article describes why I'm writing this blog and who it's for.

## Why write a blog?

I'm not a good writer, whilst I enjoyed creative writing at school it's not been a focus of my life and as a result I'm not very good at it. Often I'll tend to ramble on for too long, or structure things in a way which is hard to follow. Couple that with a mild dyslexia and it isn't always the most fantastic experience reading things I've written!

The purpose of this blog is twofold, firstly from a selfish perspective it's a practice ground for me to improve my writing, secondly it's an area to share my technical knowledge with anyone who's interested.

I've always felt that the only way to get better at something is to practice and [whilst I don't expect to become an expert](/why-i-am-not-an-expert) by writing this blog, I do hope to improve.

I would appreciate any comments and feedback from others as to the writing style & content and will endeavour to take this into account going forward (don't hold back, I can take it! (Also I can delete disqus comments, so...)).

## You know, for kids!

So, who's this for? Well, beyond my own personal developments this blog is aimed at developers who are interested in web technologies. I will post articles regarding new things I've tried, things I've worked with in the past and my experiences with them so that others can benefit.

I will include gotcha's, code examples and hopefully a small dash of humour to keep things from getting too dry.

Dispite the title, the blog is not aimed at children (explicitely anyway) but it will aim to simplify concepts and explain clearly how and when to use something. I believe that being able to explain a something in a simple and accessible terms is a good test of my own knowledge in an area, thus writing about a topic serves as a [Gear Check](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Gear_check) for my own understanding.

As Mark Twain ([possibly](http://bestlifequotesblog.com/mark-twain-didnt-time-write-shorter-letter/)) once said:

>"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."

Hopefully I won't ramble on too much!
