When choosing a technical platform for this blog I went through many different options before choosing [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
Each of those options represented a technology I have personally experienced and enjoyed using in the last year and by using all of these technologies I feel that it has enable me to make the best choice for this blog.

If I was a depth first person, I would still be using the first toolset I came across whilst I may well have become expert in this, I would be an expert in tools of the past. As an alternative, I have worked with far more tools, experience (probably) far more pain, but experience so much more, met some great people in the Open Source community and ended up putting myself out there a lot more.

My advice is to invest your time in experiencing as many new tools, frameworks and approaches as possible, the reward for this will be the experience to chose what frameworks

### .NET MVC

### Ember

### Vue

### Redis &amp; Markdown

### Gatsby


Working in a technical profession I am compelled to keep abreast of new tools and techniques; however the sheer volume of new languages, frameworks, libraries and associated best practice can make this compulsion exhausting!

Beyond basic awareness many people have a desire to become experts in these tools before they feel comfortable using them. This aspiration can become paralysing, resulting in a fear or reluctance to move away from the comfort of previous experience.

This fear is normal, but unfounded; many years ago I took the conscious decision to opt for a breadth first learning approach. I had not heard the term at the time and it was more a desire to understand all the options before diving in but I have continued to focus on learning new things versus becoming expert in one.
